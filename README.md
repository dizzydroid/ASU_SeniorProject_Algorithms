## 🧩 Welcome to our Algorithmic Analysis repository!

This interactive Java application showcases six fascinating algorithmic puzzles and problems through visualizations and step-by-step solutions. Whether you're a computer science student, an algorithms enthusiast, or just curious about computational problem-solving, this project offers an engaging way to explore classic algorithms.

## ✨ Features

This project includes beautiful interactive visualizations and solvers for the following algorithmic challenges:

### 🧩 Tromino Tiling
Tile a $2^n × 2^n$ board with L-shaped trominoes, leaving one square uncovered! This implementation uses a clever divide-and-conquer approach to solve the puzzle efficiently.

### ♞ Knight's Tour
Watch a chess knight visit every square on the board exactly once! Implemented using both backtracking and Warnsdorff's rule (greedy heuristic).

### 🗼 Tower of Hanoi
The classic recursive puzzle solved for both the standard 3-peg version and the advanced 4-peg variation (Reve's puzzle).

### ⚔️ Knights Exchange
Solve the challenging problem of exchanging the positions of two sets of knights on a chessboard with minimal moves.

### 🎯 Shooter Game
An optimization problem involving strategic positioning in a 2D grid to maximize coverage.

### 📏 Lattice Cover
Find the optimal way to cover a set of points in a plane with line segments of minimum total length.
